# Input and Output

Regular Haskell functions are pure: i.e. they must return the same result
given the same input, and they may not have side-effects (e.g. no IO).

## Compilation

Given a file helloworld.hs

    main = putStrLn "hello, world"

compile it with

    $ ghc --make helloworld
    $ ./helloworld
    hello, world

## IO actions

    > :t putStrLn
    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()

putStrLn takes a string and returns an IO action that has a return type of (or
yields) `()` (the empty tuple, aka "unit").

In this case, printing a string to the terminal doesn't have a meaningful
return value so the value it yields is kind of a dummy value.

An IO action will be performed if (and only if?) we give it the name `main` and
then run the program.

`main` can be a composite of several IO actions, e.g.

    main = do
        putStrLn "What is your name"
        name <- getLine
        putStrLn ("Hello " ++ name)

Here

    > :t getLine
    getLine :: IO String

You assign (bind) the value an IO action yields using `<-` (not `=`). Every IO
action yields a result.

In principle you can assign the `()` value yielded by putStrLn (but it's not
useful).

The last line in a do block cannot be bound to a name. The value of the last
action is yielded as the overall do block's result.

## let inside IO actions

    main = do
        putStrLn "What is your name"
        name <- getLine
        let bigname = map toUpper name
        putStrLn ("Hello " ++ bigname)

The `let` line assigns the return value of a pure function.

## Reversing input

First a regular function:

    reverseWords :: String -> String
    reverseWords = unwords . map reverse . words

so

    > reverseWords "Hello mate"
    "olleH etam"

Now a complete program `reversewords.hs`

    main = do
        line <- getLine
        if null line
            then return ()
            else do
                putStrLn $ reverseWords line
                main

    reverseWords :: String -> String
    reverseWords = unwords . map reverse . words

Then

    $ ghc --make reversewords.hs
    $ ./reversewords
    Hello mate
    olleH etam
    ^C

`main` nests `do`, which is fine.

`return` is not like the return in imperative languages. In Haskell it makes an
IO action that yields a value from a pure value. So in this case `return ()` is
just an empty IO action. We needed this because the if-then-else must evaluate
to IO actions in both branches.

For example, this is allowed and all the lines get executed

    main = do
        return ()
        return "foo"
        line <- getLine
        return "blah blah"
        putStrLn line

All the IO actions created by the returns yield values, but those values are
ignored because they are not bound to names.

Recall a do block yields the value of the IO action on the last line. If you
don't want it to yield the last value, but return () at the end to yield a
dummy value.

## IO functions

 - `putStr` is `putStrLn` without a newline. `putChar` takes a single
   character. `print` is effectively `putStrLn . show`, i.e. it prints values
   whose type is an instance of `Show` (e.g. numbers, strings). `putStrLn` only
   prints strings.

 - `when` takes a boolean and an IO action. If the boolean is true, it returns
   the IO action, otherwise returns `return ()`. It's in `Control.Monad`.
   Example:

        import Control.Monad
        main = do
            input <- getLine
            when (input == "password") $ do
                pustStrLn input

    This is equivalent to

        main = do
            input <- getLine
            if (input == "password")
                then putStrLn input
                else return ()

 - `sequence` takes a list of IO actions and returns a single action that
   performs them in succession, and yields a list containing everything they
   yield. E.g.

        main = do
            a <- getLine
            b <- getLine
            c <- getLine
            print [a, b, c]

    can be written as

        main = do
            rs = sequence [getLine, getLine, getLine]
            print rs

 - `mapM` takes a function and a list and maps the function over the list and
   then calls sequence on that list. `mapM_` does the same thing but discards
   the result.

        > mapM print [1, 2, 3]
        1
        2
        3
        [(), (), ()]

    The final line here is the list of values yielded by the three `print`
    actions.

    ```
    > mapM_ print [1, 2, 3]
    1
    2
    3
    ```

 - `forever` takes an IO action and returns an IO action that repeats the IO
   action forever. It's in `Control.Monad`.

        import Control.Monad
        import Data.Char

        main = forever $ do
            putStr "Give me input: "
            line <- getLn
            putStrLn $ map toUpper l

 - `forM` is like `mapM` but with reversed parameters, i.e. it takes a list and
   a function to map over the list.
